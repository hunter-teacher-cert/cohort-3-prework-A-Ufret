Exercise 2   The purpose of this exercise is to practice reading code and recognizing the traversal patterns in this chapter. The following methods are hard to read, because instead of using meaningful names for the variables and methods, they use names of fruit. For each method, write one sentence that describes what the method does, without getting into the details of how it works. For each variable, identify the role it plays.


public static int banana(int[] a) {
    int kiwi = 1;
    int i = 0;
    while (i < a.length) {
        kiwi = kiwi * a[i];
        i++;
    }
    return kiwi;
}
//The method "banana" takes an array of integers (a) and returns the product of all its elements.

public static int grapefruit(int[] a, int grape) {
    for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
        if (a[i] == grape) {
            return i;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
//Answer: Variables: grapefruit=method, grape=target
Description: Method grapefruit takes an array of integers and a second value (int grape)and it returns the index where the target value appears: It returns a 1 if the value is an element of the array, or -1 if not.

public static int pineapple(int[] a, int apple) {
    int pear = 0;
    for (int pine: a) {
        if (pine == apple) {
            pear++;
        }
    }
    return pear;
}
//// Answer: 
Variables: pineapple = method, apple=target, pear=i, pine= a[i]
Description: Counts the total number of appearance(s) of "apple" in array a"
     //Loop the array a 
     // End when the i-th of the array a is apple.
     // return pear.
