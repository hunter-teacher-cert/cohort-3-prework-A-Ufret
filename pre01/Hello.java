//variable - stores some value (numbers, words, images,operators, or symbols)set using String message;
//literals - the value assigned to a variable
//variable name - storage location
//expression - evaluates to a value
//operator - symobols that perform a computation (work on operands to produce a value (+))
//operand - the things the operator is working on 
//class - contains everything and has members
//methods - do something
//arguments - what you pass to a method (part of calling)
//parameter - variables to store arguments (part of definition)
//new line - \n adds space (do not include a space after \n)

//enhanced for loop -- You can read it as, â€œfor each value in values"
//Each time through the loop we use i as an index into the array, displaying the ith element. 
//You can use any expression as an index, as long as it has type "int".
